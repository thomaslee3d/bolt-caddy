Welcome to the React Project Manager, an all-in-one Python script that helps you manage, clean, analyze, and organize a React project. The tool can:

Monitor a folder for new ZIP files and automatically unzip them into a new project.
Initialize a Git repository and create a base branch.
Organize your files into logical folders (e.g., components, hooks, pages, etc.).
Analyze your code to find and remove unused dependencies.
Lint and format your code with ESLint and Prettier.
Print a directory tree, scan for specific files, or search for terms in selected files.
Generate basic error or cleanup reports.
Provide an optional GUI (PyQt5) for users who prefer a windowed interface.
NOTE: You do not have to be an expert in coding to use this. However, you will need to follow the setup instructions carefully and have the required software installed. If anything goes wrong, don’t worry—just re-check the steps or ask for help!

System Requirements
Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
Python: Version 3.7 or higher recommended.
Node.js and npm: These are needed because we install and run ESLint/Prettier (npm is the Node package manager).
Git: Needed for initializing repositories, creating branches, etc.
(Optional) PyQt5: If you want to use the GUI. Otherwise, it’s not strictly required.
Installation & Setup
Follow these steps:

Download/Clone the script

You can click “Download ZIP” from GitHub or wherever this script is hosted, or use git clone if you’re comfortable with Git.
Install Python 3

Check if you already have Python 3:
bash
Copy
python3 --version
If it says “command not found” or the version is lower than 3.7, you’ll need to install or update Python.
Python Installation Guide
Install Node.js (and npm)

Check if Node.js and npm are installed:
bash
Copy
node --version
npm --version
If not, install them from Node.js official site.
Install Git

Check if Git is installed:
bash
Copy
git --version
If not, get it from git-scm.com.
(Optional) Install PyQt5

Only if you want the GUI mode. From a terminal:
bash
Copy
pip install PyQt5
or
bash
Copy
python3 -m pip install PyQt5
(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

This step is more advanced, but it keeps your Python packages organized.
Example on macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
On Windows:
bash
Copy
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate
Then proceed with pip install PyQt5 or any other dependencies inside this environment.
Running the Tool (CLI Mode)
Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or a shell on macOS/Linux).
Navigate to the folder containing comprehensive_tool.py (the main script).
bash
Copy
cd path/to/the/script/
Make the script executable (sometimes optional depending on OS):
bash
Copy
chmod +x comprehensive_tool.py
Run the script:
bash
Copy
python3 comprehensive_tool.py
or
bash
Copy
./comprehensive_tool.py
You should see a menu with numbered choices.

Usage Guide (Menu Options)
After running the script, you will see something like this in your terminal:

==================================================
   Comprehensive React Project Management Tool
==================================================

Select an action:
1) Monitor for ZIP & auto-unzip (Git init, etc.)
2) Organize files into React folders
3) Analyze & Cleanup unused dependencies
4) Lint and Format (ESLint + Prettier)
5) Print folder tree
6) Scan directory & optionally search files
7) Run multithreaded analysis example
8) Generate placeholder error report + process error queue
9) Launch optional GUI (PyQt) [if installed]
q) Quit
Here’s what each option does:

Monitor for ZIP & auto-unzip

The script will watch a folder named ./monitored_folder for any file ending in .zip.
Once a ZIP file appears, the script automatically unzips it into ./unzipped_projects/, initializes a Git repo, and sets up a new branch.
Organize files into React folders

You’ll be prompted for a folder path. By default, it’s . (your current directory).
The script scans your project and moves files into pre-defined folders (components/, hooks/, styles/, etc.) based on patterns in the code.
Analyze & Cleanup unused dependencies

The script reads your package.json and checks which dependencies are actually imported in your code.
Any dependency that is not imported is considered “unused” and can be uninstalled automatically.
A small report is generated.
Lint and Format (ESLint + Prettier)

Installs ESLint and Prettier (if you don’t already have them).
Initializes ESLint settings, then runs eslint --fix and prettier --write on your code.
Print folder tree

Shows a tree-like listing of the files and folders, ignoring node_modules, .git, and other common hidden folders or files.
Scan directory & optionally search files

Lets you see a list of files (with numeric indices).
You can pick which files you want to search in, or pick “.” for all files.
Then enter search terms. The script prints lines that match those terms in the chosen files.
Run multithreaded analysis example

A demonstration that scans your .js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx files in parallel, showing how you might integrate concurrency for big projects.
You’ll see outputs like “Analyzed path/to/file.jsx.”
Generate placeholder error report + process error queue

Demonstrates how the tool might handle an “error queue.” For instance, if it detects an unused dependency, it can create a new Git branch, remove it, try to run the dev server, and revert if something breaks.
Launch optional GUI (PyQt)

If you installed PyQt5, this shows a basic graphical window.
From the GUI, you can do an upload or run the tool. (More advanced GUI features can be added.)
q) Quit

Exits the script.
Optional GUI Mode
If you have PyQt5 installed, you can choose option 9 from the main menu to launch a small graphical interface:

Run the script:
bash

python3 comprehensive_tool.py
Type “9” to launch the GUI.
A window appears with two main buttons:
Upload Project (ZIP): lets you pick a .zip file from your system.
Run Tool (Monitor/Unzip): triggers the script’s “monitor for ZIP” logic.
Note: This GUI is minimal but serves as a framework if you prefer a window-based approach.

FAQ & Troubleshooting
“Python not found”

Make sure you installed Python 3. Check with:
bash

python3 --version
or
bash

python --version
You may need to update your PATH or use the full path (e.g., C:\Python39\python.exe).
“npm not found”

Install Node.js from nodejs.org.
On Windows, make sure to check “Add to PATH” during installation.
“Git not found”

Install from git-scm.com and reboot your terminal.
Permission Issues (macOS / Linux)

You might need chmod +x comprehensive_tool.py or run with sudo if you have strict permissions.
Usually, installing Node or Git with standard user privileges is enough.
Lint / Prettier errors

If ESLint or Prettier fails, try deleting your node_modules and re-running the “Lint and Format” step to re-install them.
I see “Unused dependencies” that aren’t truly unused

The regex or basic scanning might not catch dynamic imports or advanced code-splitting scenarios. For best results, consider improving to an AST-based analysis or a library like depcheck.
GUI not launching

Make sure PyQt5 is installed:
bash
pip install PyQt5




If you see ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5', it means it’s not installed correctly or not installed in the same environment your script is running in.
